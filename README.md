# BlockChain
Simple project to understand How BlockChains works using HashCode of Objects. Every time a Transaction is made a Block is created 
using HashCode of the Previous or Last added block and then added to the block list (ArrayList of Objects). A single minor changes in one transaction Block will make changes in all of the transaction Block created after it. A generic transaction is the first ever transaction which will be added to the blockchain with no PreviousHashCode or previousHashCode as 0.
